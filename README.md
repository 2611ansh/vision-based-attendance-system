# Vision-Based Attendance System

This is the README file for the "Vision-Based Attendance System" project. The project aims to create an attendance system using computer vision techniques. The provided Python application file orchestrates several processes, including collecting user images for registration, generating face embeddings, training a recognition model, and making attendance predictions.

## Project Overview

The "Vision-Based Attendance System" leverages the power of computer vision to automate the attendance tracking process. It can be used in educational institutions, workplaces, or any environment where attendance needs to be recorded. The project includes the following key components:

- Collecting user images for registration.
- Generating face embeddings for recognition.
- Training a deep learning model for face recognition.
- Making real-time attendance predictions based on detected faces.
